## About this content

Files in this directory are used by project tests to assert correct library
behavior.

Most (if not all) files have very specific formatting. Any modifications to
files should be made with care. If using Visual Studio Code, choose the `File:
Save without Formatting` option to retain existing formatting.

Other editors likely have a similar mode to avoid changing existing file
formatting.
